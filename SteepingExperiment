Steeping Experiment

Begin: June 3, 2013
End: June 17, 2013

Description: In order to determine the effect of "steeping" flavors in substrates (VG and/or PG), I will be creating
various differing test mixtures. There will be 6 mixtures:
  -Test Mixture B: 12 drops VG, 12 drops tea flavor (added June 3, 2013)
  -Test Mixture A: 12 drops VG, 12 drops tea flavor (to be added June 17, 2013)
  -Test Mixture C: 12 drops PG, 12 drops tea flavor (added June 3, 2013)
  -Test Mixture D: 12 drops PG, 12 drops tea flavor (to be added June 17, 2013)
  -Test Mixture E: 12 drops 50/50 PG/VG mix, 12 drops tea flavor (added June 3, 2013)
  -Test Mixture F: 12 drops 50/50 PG/VG mix, 12 drops tea flavor (to be added June 17, 2013)

The PG/VG was added on June 3, 2013 for all mixtures. On June 17, 2013, after the tea flavor has been added to all
mixtures, there will be a double blind* taste test in which the 6 mixtures will be ranked in terms of tea flavor strength
from least strong to most strong. The results will then be analyzed to determine whether any of the flavors that
"steeped" in their substrate achieved appreciably higher strength of flavor scores than their non-steeped counterparts.

*The naming of the mixtures has been randomized. I've kept them in the original order here, but changed their names to
reflect the random ordering. It so happens that the ordering is almost identical to the initial ordering, but this was
accepted because random results don't necessarily "look random" even when they are.
